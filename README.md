# Ambar Challenge
## Aim
Project for a front-end software engineer position at [Ambar](https://www.ambar.tech/). The project consisted in a temperature data fetching app. It had to provide the user with the fetching and displaying of temperature data of three cities. 

The applicant was free to choose any city he wanted, so the ones this project covers are Ribeirão Preto/SP, Araraquara/SP and São Carlos/SP, being all of them located in Brazil. 

The API that the project makes use of to get data is [OWM](https://openweathermap.org/api). It also takes an integration with a [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), given that data persistence and realtime UI updates were requirements of the challenge.

As for design specs, the developer was allowed to design the UI as he saw fit. For these purposes, Styled Components was used and also Ant Design, a React components library that Ambar seems to implement in the front-end.
