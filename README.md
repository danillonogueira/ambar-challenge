# Ambar Challenge
## Aim
Project for a front-end software engineer position at [Ambar](https://www.ambar.tech/). The project consisted in a temperature data fetching app. It had to provide the user with the fetching and displaying of temperature data of three cities. The applicant was free to choose whatever city he wanted, so the ones this project covers are Ribeirão Preto/SP, Araraquara/SP and São Carlos/SP, all of them being located in Brazil. The API that the app makes use of to get the data is [OWM](https://openweathermap.org/api). It also takes an integration with a Realtime Database through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), given that data persistence and realtime UI updates were a requirement.
